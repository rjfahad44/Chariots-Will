        "The bible or the scriptures as it may be commonly referred to, is a compendium of God’s works. It gives us the picture of God’s and man’s relationship. It gives us the knowledge of God’s relationship with other spiritual beings like Satan, angels, and the heavenly creatures. The bible speaks of the past, the present, as well as the future. So, what is the bible? I’d simply say it’s a compendium of true stories and knowledge that all point to the all-powerful, most awesome God – it’s all about God. Man is also a very important actor in the whole biblical cast as he finds his place in the chronicles of the Almighty God because of his cherished place in the sight of God. The bible is one great book – literally and figuratively. It is full of so much knowledge. In order to understand it better for study purpose, it is divided into the Old Testament (before the coming of Jesus to earth) and the New Testament (during and after the earthly coming of Jesus). There are sixty-six books in the bible spread across the Old and New Testament – 39 in the Old Testament and 27 in the New Testament. In case you’re new to the bible and wondering what all these books are about, here’s a quick guide to get you started. Here, I give a summary of each book so you know what they’re about. We go in a chronological order according to the protestant arrangement of the bible.",

        "The bible or the scriptures as it may be commonly referred to, is a compendium of God’s works. It gives us the picture of God’s and man’s relationship. It gives us the knowledge of God’s relationship with other spiritual beings like Satan, angels, and the heavenly creatures. The bible speaks of the past, the present, as well as the future. So, what is the bible? I’d simply say it’s a compendium of true stories and knowledge that all point to the all-powerful, most awesome God – it’s all about God. Man is also a very important actor in the whole biblical cast as he finds his place in the chronicles of the Almighty God because of his cherished place in the sight of God. The bible is one great book – literally and figuratively. It is full of so much knowledge. In order to understand it better for study purpose, it is divided into the Old Testament (before the coming of Jesus to earth) and the New Testament (during and after the earthly coming of Jesus). There are sixty-six books in the bible spread across the Old and New Testament – 39 in the Old Testament and 27 in the New Testament. In case you’re new to the bible and wondering what all these books are about, here’s a quick guide to get you started. Here, I give a summary of each book so you know what they’re about. We go in a chronological order according to the protestant arrangement of the bible.",
